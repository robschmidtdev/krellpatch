The Krell Patch is a classic example of a generative synth patch — meaning it creates music or sound textures that evolve and change on their own.
It was originally designed to generate rich, otherworldly sounds automatically, inspired by the eerie sci-fi sounds from the 1950s movie “Forbidden Planet.”
It is like a self-playing sound machine that creates alien, shifting sonic environments, perfect for ambient, experimental, or sci-fi-inspired music.
